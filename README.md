- Iris Craige
- 2nd year MURP, CEDH
- I was born in San Francisco, but I have moved around the SF Bay Area for most of my life. I previously worked doing eviction defense for low-income tenants throughout the Bay. Most of my work has been centered around antidisplacement and antigentrification strategies. I enjoy making ceramics (I'm terrible, but I have a lot of heart), and going for morning walks. Below is a picture of my dog, Xochi, on a walk at Stowe Lake in Golden Gate Park. It's one of our favorite places. 
- I'm interested in mapping sideshows in the gentrified neighborhoods of the SF Bay Area, as a means for reclaiming space.
- Learning python, learning to map :)
